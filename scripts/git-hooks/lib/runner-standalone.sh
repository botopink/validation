# runner-standalone.sh — the pre-commit gate of a botopink library.
#
# Sourced by scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit. It is the only runner and it is one
# text in every library repository (the meta repository's `hook-integrity`
# workflow compares the bytes): it needs nothing outside the repository it sits
# in — standalone clone, meta checkout, worktree, bpmp packing — and it names
# no library. What differs between repositories is what their trees hold, never
# this file.
#
# Stages, in order:
#
#   1. staged files  no snapshot candidate (`*.snap.new` / `*.snap.md.new` — a
#                    mismatch writes one, it is recorded by renaming it, never
#                    committed) and no conflict marker;
#   2. the compiler  found, or the gate fails saying how to provide one;
#   3. repository    `scripts/git-hooks/repository-stages.sh`, when the
#      stages        repository tracks one: the checks only this repository has;
#   4. tests         `botopink test --target <t>` in every workspace member, on
#                    every target the member's manifest declares;
#   5. examples      `botopink build --target <t>` of every `examples/*/`, on
#                    every target its manifest declares;
#   6. refusals      every `refusals/*/` project is refused by `botopink check`
#                    with the lines of its `expect.txt`, when the repository has
#                    a `refusals/` directory.
#
# Stages 4 and 5 run their cells side by side on a pool sized to the machine
# (`gatePool`: one per CPU, bounded by memory, a cell admitted while the
# runnable threads are at most the CPUs) and print their report in plan order
# once every cell has finished — the same lines, cell for cell, the
# one-at-a-time gate printed. Front 115 of 1.0.11-beta measured emilia's
# serial hook at ~4 000 s.
#
# Fail beats warn (decision 67; 1.0.11-beta 00-gate, gate-i): nothing here
# skips. No flag, environment variable or list turns a stage off or names a
# member, target or example that may fail. A stage is absent only structurally
# — no `refusals/` directory, no `repository-stages.sh`, no `examples/` — and a
# cell is absent only because the manifest does not declare the target.
# Stages 1–3 stop the gate at the first red (they are cheap and everything
# after them depends on them); stages 4–6 all run, every red is listed, and the
# gate fails at the end — one run tells the whole truth.
#
# The functions `requireBotopink`, `runRepositoryStagesGate`, `runTestsGate`,
# `runExamplesGate` and `runRefusalsGate` are also what CI and
# `scripts/check-refusals.sh` call: they report their reds and return non-zero.
